# Lookup-Texture-Baker
A tool to bake math functions or shaders to PNG file.

<p>In most cases, sampling a texture is much faster than procedurally
calculating some patterns, lookup textures or noises. Thus, I decided 
to create a tool to quickly create and bake these kinds of visuals
into a texture file. The tool allows you to enter some math functions
as an input or select a custom shader file to visualize its result on
the inspector GUI and bake it into a PNG texture file.</p>
